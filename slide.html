<div class="section">
    <h3>Preferring Openness</h3>
    <p>
        There's a burgeoning trend of favoring open projects over traditional closed-source models, driven by their transparency, flexibility, and the community engagement they foster. However, for open projects to truly thrive and compete effectively, there is a crucial need for equitable and sustainable funding.

    <h3>Expanding Developer Ecosystem</h3>
    <p>
        The global tech landscape is undergoing a transformation, fueled by an influx of developer talent from every corner of the globe. Additionally, the rise of AI and no-code tools is ushering in a new era of software development and deployment, broadening the range of individuals who can create and contribute to applications.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Challenges for Builders</h3>
    <p>
       Freelancers are navigating an ever-growing global marketplace, yet they find themselves without the necessary tools for establishing proof of work, maintaining anonymity, and receiving compensation through equity stakes. On the other side, project owners face an acute need for decentralized funding solutions and transparent governance to ensure capital is distributed fairly. Meanwhile, contributors are seeking more access to investment opportunities in dynamic startups, along with a clearer understanding of their contribution stakes and insights into project progress.
